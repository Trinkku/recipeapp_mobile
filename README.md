# Recipe Mobile App 🍜🍲🥪🥙
 
I'm currently working on this project to develop a mobile recipe application using Expo. The application is specifically designed to help low-income students plan and prepare meals on a budget. I'm incorporating advanced features like a shopping list and a cost calculator to help users easily plan and manage their groceries. The app also has a unique search feature that allows users to find recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand.
