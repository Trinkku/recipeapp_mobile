# Recipe Mobile App 🍜🍲🥪🥙
 
Currently I am developing a mobile recipe application with Expo to learn more. The application is aimed for low-income students. The intention is to develop a shopping list and counter for the application. The user can enter the groceries to be bought into a shopping list. When the user enters the prices and weights of the raw ingredients, the counter calculates the prices of the portions using the entered data. When a user enters a raw ingredient in the search, all recipes containing that raw ingredient will be displayed.
